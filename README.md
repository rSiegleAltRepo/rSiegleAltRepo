# 💫 About Me:
### Hi there visitor👋,<br><br> this is rSiegleAltRepo, my new private repo for all things data, data science and machine learning. </br> 
This repo is maintained for data science use cases that I come across in my spare time but I also occasionally touch on data-related problems that I encounter at work. Most of my projects are written in Python or R and focus on descriptive, inferential, or predictive statistics and the use of machine learning to solve real-world problems.<br><br>- 🔭 I'm currently working on various smaller data science projects, like analyzing historical time series F1 race data for fun, or automating a workflow to log GPU performance data into a database that is plugged into a Power BI dashboard.<br></br> - 🤔 I'm also actively looking to collaborate on NLP projects that focus on implementing RAG systems to efficiently analyze unstructured data such as standard text files, pdfs, and reports.
